# Text Tree Edit Distance: A Language Model-Based Metric for Text Hierarchies.
Text trees as a data structure occur in numerous machine learning tasks like hierarchical summarization and automatic mind map generation. One of the main methods of quality evaluation in these tasks is comparison with reference hierarchies created by experts. The method used so far to compare text hierarchies, as shown in this work, poorly accounts for their structure and text semantics relative to phrasing. To address this issue, we propose a new metric on the set of text trees — text tree edit distance (TTED), based on tree edit distance with semantic distance between texts measured using a large language model. To evaluate how the metric reflects different aspects of text tree difference, we introduce special quality coefficients that reflect the sensitivity of a metric to paraphrasing relative to structural and semantic differences of text trees. Using these coefficients, we conduct extensive testing of the proposed metric and its modifications compared to a baseline used in previous works to compare text hierarchies, which shows that TTED indeed captures significant differences between text trees more accurately than the previously used method. We also provide a practical implementation of TTED for further usage.
