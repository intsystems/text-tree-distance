  "The hierarchical approach to summarization solves the issue of adapting multi-document summarization for large corpora.": {
    "It structures data into a hierarchical format, permitting users to move from overview to specifics.": {
      "This technique opposes standard single-level summaries that show complete information in one view.": {},
      "The hierarchy is constructed by categorizing associated content and producing summaries for each category.": {
        "This method may be recursive, developing summaries across different specificity levels.": {}
