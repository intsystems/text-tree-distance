  "Hierarchical summarization deals with the limitation of expanding multi-document summarization to big document groups.": {
    "It systemizes information in a branched layout, facilitating user movement from general to particular content.": {
      "This methodology diverges from traditional unified summaries that present entire information together.": {},
      "The branched organization is generated by accumulating correlated content and composing summaries for each accumulation.": {
        "This mechanism can be cyclical, assembling summaries at multiple resolution levels.": {}

    "The first implementation, Summa, utilizes this by collecting sentences and perfecting core summary features.": {
      "It arranges sentences using time-related clues to sustain story development.": {},
