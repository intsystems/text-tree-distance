    "It organizes content into a tiered framework, facilitating user progression from summaries to particulars.": {
      "This methodology diverges from traditional linear summaries that expose all content concurrently.": {},
      "The tiered organization is established by assembling correlated documents and composing summaries for each assembly.": {
        "This mechanism can be recursive, creating summaries at various abstraction levels.": {},
